# This is a wrapper script for calling generic worker, such that when the worker
# exits, this script will reboot the machine. Note, in the worker config
# (/etc/generic-worker.config) we set numberOfTasksToRun to 1 so that the worker
# will exit after running a single task. This script is then responsible for
# rebooting the machine.

# If this file exists when the worker starts up, and its content is equal
# to numberOfTasksToRun, the worker won't exit and machine won't reboot.
