# This scripts runs on remote puppetmasters that you wish to import their nodes facts into Foreman
# it uploads all of the new facts its encounter based on a control file which is stored in /tmp directory.
# This script can run in cron, e.g. once every minute
# if you run it on many puppetmasters at the same time, you might consider adding something like:
# sleep rand(10) # that not all PM hammers the DB at once.
